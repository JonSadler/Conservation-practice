This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk [little green triangle] or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

CLASS EXERCISE
NOTE: this is free text so you do not need to use a # tag. They are here for ease of translation back to a raw R code file if I need to!

Load the libraries we might need
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify) # has the autoplot function for creating the validation plots
library(car) 
```
When you attempt to save R might ask for an undated version of R markdowm. That's fine, say "yes".

# Do the following for all three data files:

# 1. load in the data and examine it's structure (including experimental balance)
# 2. Posit your hypotheses (null and alternative)
# 3. play with some pictures
# 4. draw a contingency table to figure out how the data are structured
# 5. Select an appropriate ANOVA model
# 6. Validate the model
# 7. Briefly interpret the results - in your script file!!!!

# EXERCISE 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Filename: Hoglouse.csv - a file of water louse distribution along a rivers in Devon
# response - hoglouse numbers
# explanatory variable - Upper, Mid and lower sites (i.e.  longitudinal profile)
# see Gardner's book....on the reading lists
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```{r}
Hog <- read.csv("Hoglouse.csv")
```

Look at its structure
```{r}
glimpse(Hog)
```

# Make a picture - to look at the structure

```{r}
boxplot(Hog$Count ~ Hog$ Site, col = "powderblue", xlab="Site location", ylab = "Abundance") # Not symetrical so not normally distributed
```
# with ggplot2
```{r}
ggplot(Hog, aes(Site, Count)) + geom_boxplot() #+ xlab("Site location") + ylab("Abundance"))
```

Check normality with histogram and QQ-plot

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(Hog$Count, main = "", col = "red", xlab = "Count")
qqnorm(Hog$Count); qqline(Hog$Count)
```
# Doesn't look promising for normality - check with shapiro-Wilkes test

```{r}
shapiro.test(Hog$Count)
```
# Nope - not normally distributed.

# What about heterogeneity of variances....?

```{r}
leveneTest(Hog$Count, Hog$Site) # looks fine
```

```{r}
Upper <- subset(Hog, Site == "Upper")
Mid <- subset(Hog, Site == "Mid")
Lower <- subset(Hog, Site == "Lower")
var(Upper$Count)
var(Mid$Count)
var(Lower$Count)
```
# Conclude not normally distributed with homogeneity of variance marginal = needs a non-parametric test
```{r}
kruskal.test(Hog$Count ~ Hog$Site)
```
# Interpretion
# Big difference between the means, especially in the mid regions of the river.
We can examine the differences in the individual means [someone in class asked about this - great idea!]. We do this by using Wilcox tests to compare the individual pairwise comparisons ie:
Upper to Mid
Mid to Lower
Upper to Lower.
To do this we three new dataframes with the appropriate "Site" rows comparisons

```{r}
Upper_Mid = filter(Hog,Site %in% c("Upper","Mid")) # uses dplyr to subset using multiple criteria
Mid_Lower = filter(Hog,Site %in% c("Mid","Lower"))
Upper_Lower = filter(Hog,Site %in% c("Upper","Lower"))
```
The key to this command is the 'filter' function [from the dplyr library] and the use of the %in% in conjunction with the c() function. It quite literally says " filter using dataframe Hog and column Site, extracting only the rows where the criterion is met. So for in the first example, it will only select rows in the site column that have either "Upper" or "Lower" in them.

# EXERCISES 2
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Filename: Medley.csv
# Medley and Clements (1998) investigated the impact of zinc contamination (and other
# heavy metals) on the diversity of diatom species in the USA Rocky Mountains (from
# Box 8.1 of Quinn and Keough (2002))
# File contents:
# DIATOM - number of different species of diatoms on the a known area of rocks in streams (continous variable)
# ZINC - mpm of zinc in the water column (background, low, medium, high) (factor - explanatory variable)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
Algal <- read.csv("Medley.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(Algal)
```
#note ZINC is a character and need to be a factor

```{r}
Algal$ZINC <-as.factor(Algal$ZINC)
```
# check it is now a factor
```{r}
glimpse(Algal)
```
# Make some pictures - test for normality

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(DIVERSITY ~ ZINC, data = Algal, col = "blue", ylab = "Weight (mgs)")
qqnorm(Algal$DIVERSITY); qqline(Algal$DIVERSITY)
```
# Shipiro-wilkws test
```{r}
shapiro.test(Algal$DIVERSITY)
```
Looks fine \oo/

# Variances.....?
```{r}
leveneTest(Algal$DIVERSITY, Algal$ZINC)
```
All good.

# One-way ANOVA is appropriate do we see a difference?
```{r}
summary(aov(DIVERSITY ~ ZINC, data = Algal)) # Note we can nest the summary command in the Anova call
```
# or put into an object to use later
```{r}
Model <- aov(DIVERSITY ~ ZINC, data = Algal)
summary(Model)
```
# Interpretation:
# ZINC levels impact the diversity of the diatom communities
# All other factors (e.g. flow, nutrient status, pH) being stable
# Extra bonus mark if you used a Tukey posthoc test to examine the difference between the means
```{r}
TukeyHSD(Model)
```

# EXERCISE 3
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Filename: Quinn.csv (data from By G. P. Quinn and M. J. Keough, 2002 - "Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists" )
# File contents:
# DENSITY - Limpet density treatment (L1 = 8 individals per 225 cm2 enclosure, L2 = 15, L3 = 30 and L4 = 45) (factor - explanatory variable)
# SEASON - Season of the year (Spring or summer) (factor - explanatory variable)
# EGGS - egg production by limpets (continous response variable)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# we're going to use a two-anova to analyse this....
```{r}
Limpet <- read.csv("Quinn.csv")
```
# check structure
```{r}
glimpse(Limpet)
```

# change SEASON and DENSITY to factors
```{r}
Limpet$DENSITY <- as.factor(Limpet$DENSITY)
Limpet$SEASON <- as.factor(Limpet$SEASON)
```
Plot it to see the pattern
```{r}

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(EGGS ~ DENSITY, data = Limpet, pch = 19,cex = 1.5,
     ylab = list("Eggs Produced", cex = 1.2))

plot(EGGS ~ SEASON, data = Limpet, pch = 19,cex = 1.5,
     ylab = list("Eggs Produced", cex = 1.2))
```
# both indicate likely differences for each factor. Data look relatively normal

# Check assumptions
# normality
```{r}
qqnorm(Limpet$EGGS); qqline(Limpet$EGGS)
```
```{r}
shapiro.test(Limpet$EGGS)
```
# Data are normally distributed...

# check for homogeneity of variance
```{r}
leveneTest(EGGS~DENSITY, data = Limpet)
leveneTest(EGGS~SEASON, data = Limpet)

```
# all fine....to do it graphically and account for both factors we need to run the model!

#plot interaction
```{r}
interaction.plot(Limpet$DENSITY, Limpet$SEASON, Limpet$EGGS, fun = mean)
```
# No indication of interactions

# Run ANOVA with full interactions
```{r}
Limpet_aov <- aov(EGGS ~ SEASON * DENSITY, data = Limpet)
```
# Look at the output
```{r}
summary(Limpet_aov)
```
# Results indicate that SEASON and DENSITY impact egg production. 
# There is no interaction between the two explanatory factors. 

# Confirm all diagnostics
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # set graphics device toplot four graphs in a 2 x 2 matrix
plot(Limpet_aov)
```

# Or 
```{r}
autoplot(Limpet_aov) # called from ggfortify library
```
# No visible issues! Looks excellent.
