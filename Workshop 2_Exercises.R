# Do the following for all three data files:

# 1. load in the data and examine it's structure (including experimental balance)
# 2. Posit your hypotheses (null and alternative)
# 3. play with some pictures
# 4. draw a contingency table to figure out how the data are structured
# 5. Select an appropriate ANOVA model
# 6. Validate the model
# 7. Briefly interpret the results - in your script file!!!!

# EXERCISE 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Filename: Hoglouse.csv - a file of water louse distribution along a rivers in Devon
# response - hoglouse numbers
# explanatory variable - Upper, Mid and lower sites (i.e.  longitudinal profile)
# see Gardner's book....on the reading lists
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EXERCISE 2
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Filename: Medley.csv
# Medley and Clements (1998) investigated the impact of zinc contamination (and other
# heavy metals) on the diversity of diatom species in the USA Rocky Mountains (from
# Box 8.1 of Quinn and Keough (2002))
# File contents:
# DIATOM - number of different species of diatoms on the a known area of rocks in streams (continous variable)
# ZINC - mpm of zinc in the water column (background, low, medium, high) (factor - explanatory variable)

# EXERCISE 3
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Filename: Quinn.csv (data from By G. P. Quinn and M. J. Keough, 2002 - "Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists" )
# File contents:
# DENSITY - urchin density treatment (L1 = 8 individuals per 225 cm2 enclosure, L2 = 15, L3 = 30 and L4 = 45) (factor - explanatory variable)
# SEASON - Season of the year (Spring or summer) (factor - explanatory variable)
